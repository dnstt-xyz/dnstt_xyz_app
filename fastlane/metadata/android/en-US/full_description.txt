DNSTT Client tunnels your internet traffic through DNS queries using the dnstt protocol. This creates a VPN connection that routes all device traffic through DNS, helping bypass network restrictions.

Features:
* Full device VPN tunneling on Android
* DNS server testing and management
* Multiple DNSTT configuration support
* Built-in DNS server list

The app uses the dnstt protocol which encodes data in DNS TXT queries, providing an alternative method to access the internet when other protocols are blocked.
